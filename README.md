Gautami's Kitchen

This is a project created to experiment and learn Tailwind CSS.
In order to view the project for yourself, clone the repo and open index.html with a browser of your choice.

If you choose to make changes to the project, you may need to rebuild the css generated by tailwind in order to apply the changes.
To do this, open terminal with the directory and run the following command: 
"npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch"
